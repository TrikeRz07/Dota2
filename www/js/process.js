            <p>Alliance is a Swedish professional gaming organization formed in 2013.
            The International Dota 2 Championship was held in Seattle, Washington, at the Benaroya Hall. It was the world's largest Dota 2 tournament, based on prize pool. The event was held from August 8 to August 11, 2013, at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington. This event is the third tournament to bear the name 'The International.' The first International was held in 2011 at Gamescom while the second International was held in 2012 in Seattle.
Out of the 16 participating teams, 13 were invited, with two of the remaining teams receiving their place in the tournament via two invite-only geographic qualifier tournaments, the "West Qualifier" and the "East Qualifier." The final team received their place by winning the Wildcard Match between the runners-up of the two qualifier tournaments.
The base prize pool was the same as the one used at the first and second Internationals. However, 25% of the revenue generated by the sale of the Interactive Compendium was redirected to the prize pool. The final prize pool was $2,874,380 ($1,274,380 added) USD.
